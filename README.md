Snake Game
This is a classic Snake game implemented in Python using the Turtle graphics library.
In this game, you control a snake that moves around the screen, eats food to grow longer, and tries to avoid colliding with the walls and itself.

Features
Snake Movement: Control the direction of the snake using arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right).
Food: The snake can eat food items that appear on the screen, increasing its length and your score.
Game Over: The game ends when the snake collides with the walls or itself.
Scoreboard: Keep track of your score on the screen.
Responsive Design: The game is displayed on a 600x600 pixel window with a black background.

How to Play
Run the Python script main.py to start the game.
Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the snake's movement.
Guide the snake to eat the food items that appear on the screen.
Avoid collisions with the walls and the snake's own body.
As you eat more food, your snake will grow longer, and your score will increase.
The game ends when you collide with the walls or the snake itself, and your final score is displayed.
Press the "X" button on the game window to exit the game.
